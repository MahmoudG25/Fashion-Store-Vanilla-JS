Descri: This cap is a tribute to those who’ve been through hell and came out stronger. Made for the unbreakable, it speaks to the ones who’ve lost, struggled, and risen anyway. With a bold unisex design, breathable comfort, and durable quality, it’s more than fashion — it’s quiet armor for everyday battles. Wear it as a reminder that resilience runs deep, scars are proof of survival, and no matter what tried to break you — you’re still here. Hard to Kill — and proud of it.
